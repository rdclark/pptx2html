pptx2html
=========

This project takes PowerPoint .pptx files and extracts their contents. It's based on [ANTLR 4](http://www.antlr.org/), ANother Tool for Language Recognition. 

Limitations
===========
1. This version does not preserve text formatting or slide layouts.
2. This version ignores shapes drawn with PowerPoint (that's a complex little drawing language) and might not catch all pictures.
3. The output is HTML formatted for a s6 slideshow.
